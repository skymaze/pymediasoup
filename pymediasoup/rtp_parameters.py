# The RTP send parameters describe a media stream received by mediasoup from

#
# mediasoup allows RTP send parameters with a single encoding and with multiple
# encodings (simulcast). In the latter case, each entry in the encodings array
# must include a ssrc field or a rid field (the RID RTP extension value). Check
# the Simulcast and SVC sections for more information.

# an endpoint through its corresponding mediasoup Consumer. The mid value is

# being sent to endpoints).

# producer uses simulcast). The consumer sends a single and continuous RTP
# stream to the endpoint and spatial/temporal layer selection is possible via
# consumer.setPreferredLayers().
#
# As an exception, previous bullet is not True when consuming a stream over a
# PipeTransport, in which all RTP streams from the associated producer are
# forwarded verbatim through the consumer.
#
# The RTP receive parameters will always have their ssrc values randomly
# generated for all of its  encodings (and optional rtx: { ssrc: XXXX } if the
# endpoint supports RTX), regardless of the original RTP send parameters in
# the associated producer. This applies even if the producer's encodings have
